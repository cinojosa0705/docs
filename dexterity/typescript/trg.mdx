## What is a TRG?
Trader Risk Groups (TRGs) are a component of the Dexterity protocol used to track the state of a trader's orders, 
positions, and deposits in a given `MarketProductGroup`. In other words, TRGs are individual accounts that hold and 
manage the risk information associated with a specific trader within the Dexterity framework.

By keeping track of a trader's risk information, TRGs help ensure that the trader's actions remain within acceptable 
risk levels set by the protocol. This includes monitoring the trader's margin requirements, collateralization, and 
overall account health. If a trader's actions were to exceed the risk limits defined by the Dexterity protocol, the 
Trader Risk Group would prevent those actions from being executed, protecting the overall stability and security of 
the protocol.

## Creating a TRG
TRGs are created under a specified MPG, and to create one we simply have to call the `createTrg()` async method from an initiated
instance of the `manifest`, and pass in a `PublicKey` of the desired MPG we want to create a TRG for.

For this example we're going to airdrop our wallet some devnet SOL to be able to create/mint a TRG. [Devnet Faucet](/dexterity/faucet)

<Tip>Creating a TRG is costs ~0.515 SOL in rent, you can get back your rent SOL after closing/destroying your TRG account</Tip>

```ts index.ts
...
    const mpgPubkey = new web3.PublicKey('HyWxreWnng9ZBDPYpuYugAfpCMkRkJ1oz93oyoybDFLB') // Devnet

    async function createTrg () {
        const trg = await manifest.createTrg(mpgPubkey)
        console.log('\nTRG: ', trg.toBase58())
    }

    createTrg()
```
