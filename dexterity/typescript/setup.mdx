## RPC
The first thing you're going to be needing is a Solana RPC, ideally for your production implementation you'd look for a 
very performant RPC.

Here's a list of a few, very trusted, Solana RPC providers:

For a quick setup we recomend using [Helius](https://www.helius.dev/), since they have an easy to access free tier with both Devnet & Mainnet RPCs.

(Just keep in mind that since it's free some of it's functionalities might be limited)

## Enviroment & Dependencies 
To set up your **typescript enviroment** simply follow the following:

1. Make sure you have **node** installed. [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en)

```bash
# Update npm to the latest version
npm install -g npm

# Install TypeScript globally
npm install -g typescript

# Verify installation
tsc --version
```

2. Create a new **typescript project**:
```bash
mkdir dext-project
cd dext-project

# Initialize a new Node.js project
npm init -y

# Create a tsconfig.json for TypeScript options
tsc --init
```

3. Install all the needed dependencies

    1. `@solana/web3.js` -> Solana JS Library
    2. `@hxronetwork/dexterity-ts` -> Dexterity TS SDK
    3. `@project-serum/anchor` -> Project Sereum Library

```bash
npm install @solana/web3.js @hxronetwork/dexterity-ts @project-serum/anchor
```
